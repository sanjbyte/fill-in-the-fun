# Fill in the Fun
Fill in the Fun is a Reddit-integrated word game app that turns top subreddit posts into engaging, community-driven challenges. Built using Reddit’s Devvit platform and Block UI, this app allows users to showcase their creativity, compete for upvotes, and have fun with the content they love.

How It Works
	1.  Game Start: A subreddit mod initiates the game by selecting a top post.
	2.	Player Participation: Users blank out two words in the post and replace them with their own creative or funny alternatives.
	3.	Community Voting: Submissions are posted as comments, and the community votes on their favorites.
	4.	Winning: The submission with the most upvotes wins the round.

 Installation
	1.	Clone this repository.
	2.	Configure your Devvit environment as per Devvit’s setup guide.
	3.	Deploy the app using Devvit’s CLI.
